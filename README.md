This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Perl's split function when dealing with null characters (\0). The bug.pl file contains the buggy code, while bugSolution.pl provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from how split handles null characters within the input string, which can lead to unexpected array lengths and data loss. The solution uses a more robust approach to handle null characters appropriately.
